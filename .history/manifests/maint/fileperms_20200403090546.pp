  # 6.1.1 Audit System File Permissions
  #
  # This item requires manual execution and inspection of output. It suggests a manual 
  # inspection of all installed packages on the system, which is marginally infeasible.
  # acceptance of risk for this item is encouraged, lest Puppet runs take entirely too
  # much time and unnecessarily load the system.

  # Ensure permissions on /etc/passwd are configured
  file { '/etc/passwd':
    ensure => 'present',
    owner  => 'root',
    group  => 'root',
    mode   => '0644',
  }
